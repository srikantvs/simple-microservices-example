do maven install a lot initially.
https://download.eclipse.org/m2e-wtp/releases/1.4/  -> for annoying maven first line error. and select first three and then install them
it should be okay after restart.

mvn dependency:tree -> see the dependency tree.. project dependency tree
<exclusions> -> to exclude dependency

mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose command to print the dependency conflicts. It can help us in determining if there are any incompatibility issues with a JAR.
server: 
  port: 5000

spring:
  application:
    name: brixton

eureka:zr
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:5000/eureka
      
      
      
---- after changing to DEPARTMENT-SERVICE we have to tell our resttemplate also. otherwise we will get error.
java.net.UnknownHostException: DEPARTMENT-SERVICE


that if multiple services are available connected to service registry. we have to tell the service registry to load balance the request for us in the user-service because we are calling 
DEPARTMENT-SERVICE from there.@LoadBalanced annotate the restTemplate bean.


awesome
------------------------------------------------------------------------
lets create api gateway.

 predicates:
          - Path=/some/path/to/masterplans/**, /masterplans/**


---------- 
circuit breaker
 - when one of our microservice is not working then it will run fall back methods and notify user this is not working(servie)
 
we will implement and use hystrix library in api gateway to identify which servie is up and running and which is not.
hystrix dashboard.

----
application.yml is for application context 
but we need boostrap.yml file for config .. so that we are able to craete application context from application.yml file.



first we need to start
registry
config server
gateway
services



sleuth and zipkin used for logging purpose. for distributed log tracing.
from which microservice particular log is generated. actually its very difficult to manage logs when lots of microservices are running.


so we need to implement zipkin sleuth in all ms


service name, trace id, span id, export flag.
